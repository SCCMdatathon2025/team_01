# TEAM 1: VECTOR – Video-Enhanced Combat Trauma Observation and Resuscitation

Combat trauma care is inherently high-stress, chaotic, and time-sensitive[1]. As a result, documentation is often delayed, incomplete, or inaccurate. One report found that fewer than 10% of combat casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan had any pre-hospital care documentation [2]. This gap means that critical treatment events—such as tourniquet application or airway intervention—are frequently missed in after-action reports. Manual documentation also places an added burden on medics, reducing their operational focus during critical moments.
