Combat trauma care is high-stress, chaotic, and time-sensitive[1]. Documentation is often delayed, incomplete, or inaccurate. In one report, fewer than 10% of combat casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan had pre-hospital care documentation[2]. Critical treatment events (e.g., tourniquet application, airway intervention) may be missed in after-action reports. Manual documentation burdens medics and reduces operational focus.
